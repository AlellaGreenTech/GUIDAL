# Workshop System

## Concept

**Stations** vs **Workshops**:
- **Station**: A condensed version of a workshop designed for school visits where students rotate through multiple stations in one day
- **Workshop**: A full, in-depth session focusing on one topic that individuals or small groups can book separately

## Implementation

Each station has been copied to a corresponding workshop:

## Database Integration

Workshops appear in the Activities filter on the main page under "Workshops" category. They can be booked individually and have their own:

- Duration (longer than station versions)
- Participant limits (smaller groups)
- Credit requirements
- Detailed learning objectives
- Individual instructors

## Future School Visits

School visits will be composed by selecting multiple workshops/stations that fit within the day's schedule, creating customized educational experiences.
