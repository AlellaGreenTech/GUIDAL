## User Roles

### Admin
- Full access to everything
- Can assign cashier roles
- Can create guest credits
- Can add/refund credits
- Can view all transactions

### Cashier
- Access to cashier payment app
- Can scan QR codes
- Can process payments (deduct credits)
- Can view guest balances
- Can send top-up emails
- **Cannot** add credits (admins only)

## SQL Functions

### `deduct_credit(p_qr_code, p_amount, p_description, p_location, p_metadata)`
Deducts credit from guest account. Returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "transaction_id": "uuid",
  "previous_balance": 50.00,
  "new_balance": 45.00,
  "amount_deducted": 5.00
}
```

Or if insufficient:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "insufficient_balance",
  "current_balance": 3.00,
  "requested_amount": 5.00,
  "shortfall": 2.00
}
```

### `add_credit(p_qr_code, p_amount, p_description, p_transaction_type)`
Adds credit (admins only). For refunds or top-ups.

## QR Code Format

QR codes use this format:
```
GUIDAL-XXXXXXXX
```

Example: `GUIDAL-A7B3F9D2`

The code is:
- Automatically generated
- Unique (enforced by database)
- Case-insensitive for scanning
- Links to exactly one guest_credit record

## Mobile App Features

### Scanner Mode
- Uses device camera
- Auto-detects QR codes
- Vibrates on successful scan (if supported)
- Falls back to manual entry if camera fails

### Payment Flow
1. Scan QR code
2. See guest name and balance
3. Select item or enter custom amount
4. Optionally select location
5. Click "Process Payment"
6. See confirmation and new balance
7. View transaction in history

### Insufficient Credit Flow
1. Scan QR code
2. See low/zero balance
3. Click "Send Top-Up Email"
4. Confirm email address
5. Email sent with PayPal payment link
6. Guest receives email
7. Guest pays via PayPal
8. Balance auto-updates (via webhook - to be implemented)

## Integration with Pumpkin Patch Orders

Guest credits can be linked to pumpkin patch orders:

```sql
UPDATE guest_credits
SET order_id = '<pumpkin_order_id>'
WHERE id = '<guest_credit_id>';
```

This allows tracking which order generated the credit.

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- âœ… Only cashiers and admins can view/update guest_credits
- âœ… Only cashiers and admins can insert transactions
- âœ… Only admins can create guest credits
- âœ… Only admins can add credits (refunds/top-ups)

### SQL Injection Protection
- âœ… All queries use parameterized functions
- âœ… RPC functions validate user roles
- âœ… Input validation on client side

### Authentication
- âœ… Supabase Auth required
- âœ… Role checked on every page load
- âœ… Unauthorized users redirected

## TODO / Future Enhancements

### âœ… Completed
- Database schema
- Admin interface
- Cashier mobile app
- QR code generation
- Credit deduction
- Transaction logging

### ðŸ”¨ In Progress
- Top-up email functionality
- PayPal integration for top-ups

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- SMS notifications for low balance
- Bulk QR code generation
- Print QR codes as PDF
- Transaction analytics dashboard
- Export transactions to CSV
- Cashier performance reports
- Guest credit expiration automation
- WhatsApp top-up notifications

## Quick Start Commands

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('guest_credits', 'credit_transactions', 'payment_link_requests');

-- Create a test guest credit
INSERT INTO guest_credits (guest_name, guest_email, qr_code, credit_balance, initial_credit)
VALUES ('Test Guest', 'test@example.com', 'GUIDAL-TEST01', 50.00, 50.00);

-- Assign cashier role
UPDATE user_profiles
SET role = 'cashier'
WHERE user_id = '<user_id>';

-- View all transactions
SELECT * FROM credit_transactions
ORDER BY transaction_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**System Status:** âœ… Ready for Testing
**Next Step:** Run database migration and assign first cashier
