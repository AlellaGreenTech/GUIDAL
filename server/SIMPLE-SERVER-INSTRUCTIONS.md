# 🚀 SIMPLE SERVER SOLUTION - GUARANTEED PORT 8080

## The Problem
VS Code Live Server keeps using port 5500 and ignoring our settings.

## The Solution
Use Python's built-in HTTP server instead!

## 🔥 SIMPLE COMMANDS TO RUN YOUR SERVER:

### **Option 1: Port 8080 (Recommended)**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### **Option 2: Port 8000 (if available)**  
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### **Option 3: Any available port**
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
(This will use port 8000 by default, or find the next available port)

## 🌐 Access Your Site:

After running the command, your GUIDAL GREENs system will be available at:

- **Home**: `http://localhost:8080/index.html`
- **GREENs Registration**: `http://localhost:8080/register.html`  
- **GREENs Login**: `http://localhost:8080/login-greens.html`
- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard.html`
- **System Test**: `http://localhost:8080/test-greens.html`

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
2. **Navigate to your GUIDAL project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/martinpicard/Websites/GUIDAL
   ```
3. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```
4. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:8080`
5. **To stop the server**: Press `Ctrl+C`

## ✅ Benefits of This Approach:

- ✨ **No VS Code Extension needed**
- 🎯 **You control the exact port**  
- 🔧 **Works on any computer with Python**
- 🚀 **Starts instantly**
- 💡 **Simple and reliable**

## 🛑 Important Notes:

- **Ignore VS Code Live Server** - Don't use it anymore
- **Python is pre-installed** on Mac (which you're using)
- **The server runs until you stop it** with Ctrl+C
- **Your files auto-refresh** when you reload the browser page

## 🎉 THAT'S IT! 

No more fighting with VS Code settings. Just run `python3 -m http.server 8080` and you're good to go! 

Your GREENs system will be running on exactly the port you want. 🌱
