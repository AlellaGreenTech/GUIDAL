## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Supabase Project Setup

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   ```
   1. Go to https://supabase.com
   2. Sign up/login and create a new project
   3. Choose project name: "GUIDAL"
   4. Set a strong database password
   5. Select your preferred region
   ```

2. **Get Your Project Credentials**
   ```
   1. Go to Settings > API in your Supabase dashboard
   2. Copy your Project URL and Anon public key
   3. Update js/supabase-client.js with your credentials:

   const SUPABASE_URL = 'your-project-url'
   const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'your-anon-key'
   ```

### Step 2: Database Schema Setup

Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL editor in order:

1. **Main Schema** (Required)
   ```sql
   -- Run: database/database-schema.sql
   -- This creates all core tables and relationships
   ```

2. **Notifications System** (Required)
   ```sql
   -- Run: database/notifications-schema.sql
   -- This adds the notification system tables and functions
   ```

3. **Storage Setup** (Required)
   ```sql
   -- Run: database/storage-setup.sql
   -- This creates storage buckets and policies for file uploads
   ```

4. **Sample Data** (Optional)
   ```sql
   -- Run: database/sample-data.sql
   -- This adds sample schools and activities for testing
   ```

### Step 3: Authentication Configuration

1. **Enable Email Authentication**
   ```
   1. Go to Authentication > Settings in Supabase
   2. Ensure Email/Password is enabled
   3. Set Site URL to your domain (e.g., https://your-domain.com)
   4. Add redirect URLs for development and production:
      - http://localhost:5500 (for development)
      - https://your-domain.com (for production)
   ```

2. **Email Templates** (Optional)
   ```
   1. Go to Authentication > Email Templates
   2. Customize confirmation and password reset emails
   3. Update links to point to your domain
   ```

### Step 4: Row Level Security (RLS)

The schema includes comprehensive RLS policies, but you may want to review and customize:

```sql
-- Example: Allow users to read their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Example: Admin-only access to certain tables
CREATE POLICY "Admin only" ON activities
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE id = auth.uid()
      AND user_type = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

### Step 5: File Storage Configuration

Storage buckets are automatically created by the setup script:

- **`avatars`** - Public bucket for user profile pictures
- **`activity-images`** - Public bucket for activity photos
- **`documents`** - Private bucket for user documents

### Step 6: Test Your Setup

1. **Test Database Connection**
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console on your site and run:
   GuidalDB.testConnection()
   ```

2. **Test User Registration**
   ```
   1. Go to pages/auth/register.html
   2. Create a test account
   3. Check your email for verification
   4. Try logging in at pages/auth/login.html
   ```

3. **Test Admin Functions**
   ```
   1. Manually set a user's user_type to 'admin' in Supabase
   2. Visit pages/admin/dashboard.html
   3. Verify admin functionality works
   ```

  CHECK (user_type IN ('student', 'teacher', 'admin', 'staff', 'guest', 'your_new_type'));
```

2. Update the registration form and admin interface

```

2. Update the frontend activity type handling

### Customizing Notifications
