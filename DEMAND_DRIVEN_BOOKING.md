# Demand-Driven Booking System

## Overview

The GUIDAL app now includes a comprehensive demand-driven booking system for science-in-action activities. This system allows users to request new session dates and gather participants through share links, ensuring activities only run when there's sufficient demand.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All components have been successfully implemented and integrated.

## üéØ System Architecture

### Database Schema
- **booking_requests**: Main booking table with participant tracking
- **booking_participants**: Individual participant records
- **booking_configuration**: Admin-configurable restrictions and settings
- **Enhanced RLS policies**: Secure access control
- **Database functions**: Automated participant counting and status updates

### Core Components

#### 1. Booking Modal (`/components/booking-modal.html`)
Three-step booking workflow:
- **Step 1**: Choose date or join existing sessions
- **Step 2**: Booking created with share link generation
- **Step 3**: Join existing booking flow

#### 2. Admin Configuration (`/components/admin-booking-config.html`)
Comprehensive admin interface for:
- Date restrictions (blocked days/ranges)
- Available time slots configuration
- Activity-specific settings (min/max participants, pricing)
- Booking parameters (advance booking requirements)

#### 3. JavaScript Implementation (`/js/app.js` + `/js/admin-booking-config.js`)
- Complete booking workflow management
- Share link system with URL parameter handling
- Admin configuration manager
- Real-time validation and restriction enforcement

## üöÄ How It Works

### User Flow
1. **Discovery**: User browses science-in-action activities in main app
2. **Booking Intent**: Clicks "Book Station" button on any activity
3. **Modal Opens**: Shows existing sessions or new booking form
4. **Date Selection**: Picks date/time with admin restrictions applied
5. **Booking Created**: System generates unique booking with share link
6. **Recruitment**: User shares link via email/WhatsApp to gather participants
7. **Others Join**: Friends/colleagues use share link to join the booking
8. **Threshold Met**: When minimum participants reached, all get notified
9. **Confirmation**: Participants have 48 hours to confirm payment
10. **Session Confirmed**: Activity scheduled once everyone confirms

### Admin Flow
1. **Access**: Navigate to `/admin/booking-config.html`
2. **Configure**: Set date restrictions, time slots, activity rules
3. **Save**: Changes apply immediately to new bookings
4. **Monitor**: Track booking requests and participant progress
