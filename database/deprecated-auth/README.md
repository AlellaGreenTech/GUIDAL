# Deprecated Authentication Files

This folder contains authentication files that have been consolidated into the main login system.

## Files moved here:
- `login-greens.html` - Separate GREENs blockchain login (now integrated into main login.html)

## Current active login system:
Use `../../pages/auth/login.html` instead - it now includes:
- Regular login/register
- School visit access
- GREENs rewards information
- Single unified authentication system

The GREENs system is now a perk/reward feature of the main GUIDAL account system, not a separate login system.
