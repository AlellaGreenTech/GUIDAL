# Deprecated SQL Files

This folder contains the original separate schema files that have been consolidated into `../complete-schema.sql`.

## Files moved here:
- `database-schema.sql` - Original main database schema
- `notifications-schema.sql` - Notifications system schema
- `storage-setup.sql` - Supabase storage configuration

## Current active schema:
Use `../complete-schema.sql` instead - it contains all of these files combined in the correct dependency order.

These files are kept for reference but should not be used for new deployments.
